## Testing

Testing was conducted throughout the website development with the help of Dev Tools. All the internal and external links and form have been checked if they are working correctly. External links are opening out in a new tab as they should and internal links lead to the intended destination. 

Testing of form was carried out with trying out different variations:

1. Trying to submit form without filling out any field. Form feedback indicated that name field should be filled out. 
2. After filling the name and clicked on submit, popped out the message that email should be filled out.
3. When filling out the email field with random data comes out warning that the field must include sign "@". 
4. When filling out the right email information, and trying to submit,comes out the warning to fill out the phone number.
5. After name, email and phone number is filled out it comes back that radio buttons must been selected.
6. After all of the above is filled and clicked on submit, then comes warning that message must be written.
7. When all is selected and filled except date, the form would be succesfully sent and it would redirect to confirmation page.
8. Testing included all possible variations and each time form has reacted appropriately, that on of the fields should be filled out or button to be chosen.
