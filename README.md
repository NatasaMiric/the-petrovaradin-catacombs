### Future Implementations

### Accessibility

When creating this website, I paid great attention to its accessibility:

* The site consists of three separate pages in order to avoid excessive scrolling down the page and in the same time it's easier to access to relevant informations. It is also practical if in the future content expands. 
* Image content includes proper textual alternatives so that they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users.
* Site has a sufficient colour contrast and fonts that are easy to read.
