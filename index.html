                <p>Located high on the right bank of the Danube River in the city of Novi Sad, the Petrovaradin
                    Fortress
                    has
                    played a significant role in Serbia’s history. Starting in the 17th century, the Austrians spent
                    nearly a
                    century building new fortifications,
                    including new walls, water moats and channels with movable bridges and control gates.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Hidden beneath the fortress are underground military galleries—often referred to as the
                    catacombs—
                    that
                    create a four-story, 16 kilometers long network of passageways that have not yet been fully
                    explored.
                    The part that is accessible to the general public can be visited in organized tours led by
                    professionally trained guides.</p>
